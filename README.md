Pokedex Web App
===============

This is a simple Pokedex web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app retrieves data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) and displays a list of Pokemon with their names, numbers, types, and images.

The app features a "Load More" button that allows users to retrieve more Pokemon from the API in batches of 10. The maximum number of Pokemon that can be retrieved is 150.
